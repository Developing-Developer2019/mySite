                <h1>UK growth 'slowest in almost a decade'</h1>

                <time datetime="2019-11-12T18:09:48+00:00">14 hours ago.</time>
                <p>Britain's economy has grown at the slowest annual rate in
                    almost a decade, according to official figures. </p>

                <p>Year-on-year growth in the three months to end-September
                    slowed to 1% from 1.3% in the second quarter, the Office for
                    National Statistics said.</p>

                <p>An ONS spokesman said: "Looking at the picture over the last
                    year,
                    growth slowed to its lowest rate in almost a decade." </p>
                <p>But the economy avoided a recession by growing 0.3% in the
                    third quarter. </p>

                <p>The economy had shrunk in the second quarter and two

            <article>
                <p>Britain's economy has grown at the slowest annual rate in
                almost a decade, according to official figures.</p>

                <p>Year-on-year growth in the three months to end-September
                slowed to 1% from 1.3% in the second quarter, the Office for National
                Statistics said.</p>

                <p>An ONS spokesman said: "Looking at the picture over the last
                year, growth slowed to its lowest rate in almost a decade."</p>
                
                <p>But the economy avoided a recession by growing 0.3% in the
                third quarter.</p>

                <p>The economy had shrunk in the second quarter and two
                quarters of contraction would have signalled a recession.</p>

                <h3>What happened in the three-month period?</h3>

                <p>Despite the economy expanding by 0.3% in the third quarter,
                it was not as fast as the 0.4% forecast by economists, including at
                the Bank of England.</p>

                <p>A statistician at the ONS said GDP grew "steadily" in the third quarter. That was largely as a result of a "strong July".</p>

                <p>"The underlying trade deficit narrowed, mainly due to growing exports of both goods and services."</p>

                <br><h3>What happened in September?</h3>

                <br>In the month of September, GDP fell by 0.1%, as had been
                expected.<br>

                <br>But the ONS revised down the contraction in August to 0.2%
                from
                0.1%.<br>

                <br>It was the growth of 0.3% in July that drove the economy in
                the
                whole of the third quarter.<br>

            <article>
                <br>Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors,
                said
                that
                "a return to growth is welcome news, but narrowly avoiding a
                recession is nothing to celebrate".<br>

                <br>"The UK economy has been in stop-start mode all year, with
                growth
                punctuated by the various Brexit deadlines," he added.<br>

                <br>Ms Gregory added: "While the election is just under five
                weeks
                away,
                clearly this isn't the good news the government might have hoped
                for."<br>
            </article>

            <br><h3>Was Brexit stockpiling important?</h3>

            <article>
                <br>The economy had unexpectedly contracted by 0.2% in the
                second
                quarter - the March to June period - when Brexit stockpiles were
                unwound after the first Brexit date of 29 March.<br>

                <br>Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said a
                "renewed
                stockpiling boost" failed to materalise in the third quarter.<br>
                <br>"It possible that stockpiling occurred to a greater extent
                at
                the
                start of the fourth quarter," he said, adding fourth-quarter
                growth
                might not be depressed to the extent he expected.<br>

                <br>But Mr Parikh said that "the final quarter of 2019 could be
                weaker
                as stockpiles continue to be run down".<br>

                <br><h3>What are the politicians saying?</h3>

                <br>The Chancellor, Sajid Javid, said there figures were
                "another
                welcome sign that the fundamentals of the UK economy are strong.
                Under the conservatives, we've seen nine consecutive years of
                growth".<br>

                <br>He added: "What it also shows is the real risk to growth in
                our
                economy is Corbyn's Labour. If they get their way, two
                referendums
                in 2020, eye watering amounts of spending and borrowing and
                debt,
                that kind of economic vandalism will bring growth in this
                country to
                a halt."<br>

                <br>But John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: "The fact
                that
                the
                government will be celebrating 0.1% growth in the last six
                months is
                a sign of how low their hopes and expectations for our economy
                are."
                Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat's deputy leader said: "The
                economy
                under the Tories is anaemic."<br>

            <article>
                <br> As much as it would be a relief that a formal recession has
                been avoided, the picture is very sluggish, in keeping with what
                has
                been called a "slow puncture" economy.<br>

                <br>Growth of 0.3% between July and September is clearly
                preferable
                to another quarter of contraction, but still slow by normal
                historical standards.<br>

                <br>Indeed, comparing the third quarter this year with the same
                period last year, growth of just 1% is the slowest since the
                aftermath of the financial crisis. It is the weakest two
                quarters
                since the financial crisis.<br>

                <br>The background is a slower European and world economy
                reeling
                from trade wars.<br>

                <br>But years of damaged business investment, after the Brexit
                referendum, are taking their toll on growth.<br>

                <br>The latest figures in the month of September showed a
                contraction of 0.1%. Data has been volatile this year, with car
                industry shutdowns and two bouts of ultimately unneeded no-deal
                Brexit stockpiling.<br>

                <br>So recession avoided, but this is not the "bounce back"
                promised
                by some.<br>
